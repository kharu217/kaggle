# Dataset Information
# ------------------
# Dataset: CottonWeedDet3 - Cotton Weed Detection Challenge
# Purpose: Real-world agricultural weed detection with imperfect labels
# Format: YOLOv8 (YOLO format with normalized bounding boxes)
# 
# Dataset Statistics:
#   - Training images: 542
#   - Validation images: 133
#   - Test images: 170
#   - Total images: 845
#
# Classes:
#   - Class 0 (carpetweed): Mat-forming competitor weed
#   - Class 1 (morningglory): Climbing vine causing major yield losses
#   - Class 2 (palmer_amaranth): Herbicide-resistant "super weed"
#
# Label Format:
#   - Each .txt file contains one line per object
#   - Format: <class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
#   - All coordinates are normalized (0-1)
#
# Notes:
#   - This dataset intentionally includes labeling imperfections to simulate
#     real-world annotation challenges
#   - Recommended approach: Use data-centric AI techniques to iteratively
#     improve label quality through train-fix-retrain loops
#   - Optimized for YOLOv8n with 640x640 input size for edge deployment
